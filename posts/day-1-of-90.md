The journey begins but with a single step. The first thing I want is a place to document each day of development on my projects and so my first project will be
to create a blog. Ideally I want to use is React, since it's on my list of things to learn, but I'm ambivalent about all other parts of the tech stack.
Searching for tutorials I found many, but they either used endless frameworks and extra little modules, which is pretty useless when trying to learn an
individual technology, or they were very outdated. In the end I found one, viewable at https://coding-blog.crfcourses.com/preview/introduction, that suits my
needs.

I've started following through the tutorial, so far so good, everything is explained well and is perfectly suited to my needs. My plan for this is to follow the
straight to the end and then come back and customise the website to my liking and exact needs. Only spent about an hour and a half on todays development.
