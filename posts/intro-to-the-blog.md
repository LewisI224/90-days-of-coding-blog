Hi, I'm Lewis and soon I will be a computer science graduate. Between now, a couple days after submitting my final year dissertation,
and the 5th of September I have 133 days of complete freedom. So rather than wasting this I thought I'd get to grips with some
technologies and languages I'm less confident with like React, Node, Kotlin and Swift all of which I expect to use in my job.

Now 133 days of coding isnt as nice sounding for a title of a blog as 90 days of coding I hope you'll agree, so accounting for 8 days of a family holiday,
2 weeks of relaxation before starting my job and a sprinkling of some random lazy days I've gone from 133 to 90 days. Rather than going blind from reading
boring and quickly outdated textbooks or sitting at my computer with a wandering mind watching a youtube video I prefer to learn by doing projects, so the plan
is to split my 90 days into a series of projects, some big and some small.

Starting off, to document my journey I want to create my own blog site. This will be a good space for me to ramble about issues and a nice way to look back on
the journey at the end of the 90 days. On the github repository where all the code for the projects will be stored, I have a readme containing a checklist of my
project ideas and some links to written tutorials that I'll follow to help me with each of the projects (not only do these help with any issues, they also help
with my complete lack of imagination for ideas).

P.S This does't count as one of the 90 days it's almost midnight when I'm typing this.
